# Define a procedure, square, that takes one number
# as its input, and returns the square of that
# number (result of multiplying
# the number by itself).
# To help you out, the code for sum(a,b) is below.

def sum(a,b):
    c = a + b
    return c

def square(n):
    r = n*n
    return str(n) + ' squared = ' + str(r)



# To test your procedure, uncomment the print
# statement below, by removing the hash mark (#)
# at the beginning of the line.

# Do not remove the # from in front of the line
# with the arrows (>>>). Lines which begin like
# this (#>>>) are included to show the results
# you should see when run your procedure.

print (square(3098437734029))
